                        INTRODUCE jdbc
   First,in my opinion the jdbc is a interface definded by sun, a company of
computer.I think the interface is to normalize the process of connection to
diferent databases.By doing so,users can easily to connection all kind of
databases that realize the protocal of JDBC as long as they have knowledge of
how to use JDBC.
  In my project (2018-5-27-mysql-jdbc),I will show you how to use jdbc to
  connect mysql.First you need to write the configuration information about
  you mysql in form of properties and put it under the directoty of src in
  your project. Then three methods to get configuration will appear in my folder
  named utils.Last in the folder named test,I use my method to accomplish the
  insert,update delete and select to uer information in mydb1 a databases named
  mydb1.
